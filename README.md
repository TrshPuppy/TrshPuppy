*What would I do with a million dollars?* I'll tell you what I'd do, coding and cybersecutiry at the same time!

## I am a young technology professional who spends nearly every day coding and learning cybersecurity.
If you peruse my repositories you'll find many unique projects, from a [JS Twitch Chatbot](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/trsh_bot) to a [C# horror game in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpIVc9XPZcc). There's even a [repo of all my notetaking](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes) on computers, math, and hacking.

## Checkout my ever-updating [Portfolio](https://trshpuppy.github.io) with live previews of a few of my projects!
